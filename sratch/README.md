# sratch aka scratch notes

Scratch notes during the development of YAABE. Mainly about relearning C and
testing out ideas for the bios editor.

"sratch" because typo that I never bothered to fix (and would mess up ctrl-r
searching).

I'm publishing this in case if anyone finds anything remotely useful. Will
probably be removed from the tree eventually.
